I created this Android app for the purposes of the [Udacity's Developing Android Apps with Kotlin Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-kotlin-developer-nanodegree--nd940) to showcase my skills in **Android developement**.

# Tools

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) 
* [View Model](https://bit.ly/3e43P79) - The View Model class is designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [Live Data](https://bit.ly/3KuahQR) - LiveData is an observable data holder class. Unlike a regular observable, LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it respects the lifecycle of other app components, such as activities, fragments, or services.
* [Data Binding](https://bit.ly/3PVsjNc) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started)
* [ConstraintLayout](https://developer.android.com/training/constraint-layout)
* [Repository Pattern](https://medium.com/swlh/repository-pattern-in-android-c31d0268118c)
* [Dependency Injection (Hilt)](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) - Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
